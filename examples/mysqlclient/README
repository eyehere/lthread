Implemented approach that i first time saw in ribs2 - it's called 'ribify' there.
The point is to make any library, written in blocked io, to be able to work with lthread
in true asynchronous style, without blocking the os thread. It is achieved by replacing
standard socket api functions by it's lthread analogs. For this to happen, some missing
functions was added in lthread library.

First, run the lthread.sql to create database and the user:
$ msyql -u root -p < lthread.sql

To compile the example, mysqlclient/mariadbclient dev package should be installed.
Tested on mariadb client 5.5.36, but should work on any version.

To build, simply type make.
